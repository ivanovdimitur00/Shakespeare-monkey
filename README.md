## Project status
Completed and working. Not expecting changes.
<br/>
<br/>

## Description
The purpose and goal of the project is to create a program, realizing a genetic algorithm. That's about it. The objects of the program were left up to me to pick.

The intended audiences for the project are my erasmus coordinator and myself.
<br/>
<br/>

## Project requirements
Look at [the description](#Description). 
<br/>
<br/>

## Algorithm explanation
The general algortihm is explained in several places:
1. [The document](Genetic_Algorithm_en.pdf), provided by my erasmus coordinator.
2. This [video tutorial](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/29-smart-rockets-in-p5js) or this [website guide](https://natureofcode.com/genetic-algorithms/)
3. These "draw.io diagrams" (in the folder of the same name) I made to explain what genetic algorithms were to myself.
